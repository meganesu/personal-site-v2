Coming soon! This is where I talk about things I've built.

Some cool things I've worked on:

- Started and managed weekly Twitter chats from the [@DevEdBookClub Twitter](https://twitter.com/DevEdBookClub), alongside Aisha Blake and Christina Gorton (2021)
- Wrote the v3 version of the [official Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) (2021)
- [Reorganized the Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/announcing-new-gatsby-docs-site/) (2020)
