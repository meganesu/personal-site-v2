I want to make sure this site is accessible and usable by everyone.

I'm currently using the W3C <OutboundLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</OutboundLink> as a standard. It defines three different levels of accessibility conformance (A, AA, AAA). My goal is to achieve level AA.

If you find any accessibility issues, please reach out and let me know! The best way to contact me is to reach out on <OutboundLink href="https://twitter.com/meganesulli">Twitter</OutboundLink>.
