I'm currently using Google Analytics to collect data about visitors to this site (that's you!). Eventually I'd love to move away from using Google and rolling my own simple analytics solution, but I haven't figured out quite how to do that yet.

So in the meantime, here's a list of some data that's being collected and how I'm using it:

- What pages you're visiting. I use this data to understand which of my posts are more popular, so that I can keep making content that's useful to you.
- Whether you're on a desktop or mobile device. I use this data so that I can make sure my site has a good user experience on whatever platform you might be using.
- How you got to my site. I use this data to understand how to better promote my content so that I can get it to you more effectively.

## Want a more comprehensive list of what data Google Analytics tracks?

## Don't want me to collect this info about you?

If you want to opt out of Google Analytics across sites, look into something like this [opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).)

## Have a different privacy-focused analytics platform that you prefer?

I'd love to hear about it! Reach out to me on Twitter and let me know about your experience.
