# <span class={styles.wave}>ðŸ‘‹</span> Hey there, I'm Megan!

I'm a software developer and educator. I like building things and then <Link to="/blog">teaching others</Link> about what I've learned.

When I'm not on my computer, I'm a dog volunteer at <OutboundLink href="https://www.oaklandanimalservices.org/">Oakland Animal Services</OutboundLink>.
