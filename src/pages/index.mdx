# <span class={styles.wave}>👋</span> Hey there, I'm Megan!

I'm a software developer and educator who's passionate about helping people use tech for good.

* I like <Link to="/now">learning new things</Link> and then <Link to="/blog">sharing my knowledge</Link> with others.
* I've been a full-time software developer since 2018. You can read more about <Link to="/journey">my journey into tech</Link> or <Link to="manual">my personal user manual</Link>.
* When I'm not on my computer, I'm probably gardening in my backyard or playing with my dog, Clifford.
