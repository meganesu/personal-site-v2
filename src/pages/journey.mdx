# How I Got Here

I had a bit of a roundabout journey to becoming a developer.

I first learned to program in college, where I majored in computer science. But by the time I reached my senior year, I'd decided that I didn't want to be a developer. (In retrospect, that was partially due to a lack of relatable role models and partially because I mistakenly thought developers were just "code monkeys" at a giant tech companies.)

Around the same time, I became a teaching assistant for the introductory CS course. I loved helping students progress from feeling completely overwhelmed to gaining confidence in their abilities. I decided to go into education after graduation, because I saw teaching as a way to have a direct impact on people's lives.

After college, I served a year as a [City Year](https://www.cityyear.org/) AmeriCorps member in New York City, where I supported a third-grade classroom and taught my students how to code during our lunch breaks. After that, I interned on the Education team at [Code.org](https://code.org/), and then I worked at [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) as a curriculum writer.

While I was at Girls Who Code, I wrote several Women in Tech Spotlights. Each spotlight higlighted the work of a different woman and the way she was using computer science to have an impact in her community. Researching those spotlights introduced me to the kinds of role models I wish I'd had in college. Suddenly I felt inspired to become a developer, so that I too could use programming as a tool for bringing about positive change.

In 2018, I got my first full-time developer job as a consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). Now, I'm a senior software engineer at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), where I focus on writing and improving documentation.
