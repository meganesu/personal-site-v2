  What I'm Up To Now
</RouteTargetHeading>


I'm currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. For work, I'm a senior software engineer at Gatsby, where I focus on documentation.

Over the past few months, I've been getting really into cross-stitch. I've got a handful of projects I'm bouncing between at the moment:

* [Pok√©mon Red/Blue sprites poster](https://www.etsy.com/listing/593273895/pokemon-red-blue-cross-stitch-pattern)
* [Wizard of Oz stitch-along](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1003686199/wizard-of-oz-satsuma-street-secret-sal)

I also have a personal goal for 2021 to draw for ten minutes a day. I've been making lots of pet portraits in Procreate, and I'm starting to get into digital hand lettering.

I post about my art and cross-stitch progress on [my crafting Instagram](https://instagram.com/meganesulli).

I also spend a lot of time training and cuddling my dog, [Clifford](https://instagram.com/clifford.the.medium.red.dog/).

## Things I'm Learning

* [Teaching Tech Together: How to Make Lessons That Work and Build a Teaching Community Around Them](https://teachtogether.tech/), by Greg Wilson: A book about learning science, educational best practices, and research-backed strategies for teaching programming.
* [Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can't Transform Education](https://failuretodisrupt.com/), by Justin Reich: A book that talks about the different types of technologies that creators claimed would revolutionize education, and the reasons why the actual impact on student learning hasn't been as widespread as expected.
* [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/), by Josh W. Comeau: An online self-paced course to help JS developers build mental models of how CSS works.
* [Web Accessibility Curriculum 2.0](https://dequeuniversity.com/), by Deque University: An online self-paced course about how to build websites and web apps that are accessible for all users.

I take more detailed notes on the things I'm learning in my [Today I Learned (TIL) repo](https://github.com/meganesu/TIL).
