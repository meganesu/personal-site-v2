# What I'm Up To Now

I'm currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. For work, I'm a senior software engineer at Gatsby, where I focus on documentation.

Now that it's COVID Times, I'm playing a lot more video games, mainly on my Nintendo Switch. I'm currently obsessed with Hades. Before that, I was playing a lot of Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

I also spend a lot of time training my new dog, Clifford.

## Things I'm Learning
