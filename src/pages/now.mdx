  What I'm Up To Now
</RouteTargetHeading>

I'm currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. For work, I'm a developer educator at [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), where I work on building content for the [Odyssey learning platform](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/). I also run the weekly [#DevEdBookClub Twitter chats](https://twitter.com/DevEdBookClub), which were started by [Aisha Blake](https://twitter.com/AishaBlake), [Christina Gorton](https://twitter.com/coffeecraftcode), and myself.

Since the pandemic, I've gotten really into cross-stitch. I've got a handful of projects I'm bouncing between at the moment, which you can check out on [my crafting Instagram](https://instagram.com/meganesulli). I also occasionally post my Procreate art there.

When I'm not in front of a screen, I spend time training and cuddling my dog, [Clifford](https://instagram.com/clifford.the.medium.red.dog/).

## Things I'm Learning

* [The Programmer's Brain: What every programmer needs to know about cognition](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain), by Felienne Hermans: A book about how your brain works and how to learn new programming concepts effectively.
* I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking, and I'm tinkering with my personal knowledge management setup.

I take more detailed notes on the things I'm learning in my [Today I Learned (TIL) repo](https://github.com/meganesu/TIL).
