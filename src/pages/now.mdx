  What I'm Up To Now
</RouteTargetHeading>

(Last updated July 2023)

I'm currently based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. For work, I'm a developer educator at [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), where I build courses about Workday Extend.

I've got a handful of crafting projects I'm bouncing between at the moment, which you can check out on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/meganesulli). Right now it's mostly cross-stitch, with some crochet, sewing, and digital art mixed in.

When I'm not in front of a screen, I spend time training and cuddling my dog, [Clifford](https://instagram.com/clifford.the.medium.red.dog/).

## Things I'm Learning

- I'm currently enrolled in an online Graphic Memoir class taught by Sarah Shaw through the School of Visual Arts. It's a great class, and I love the collaborative environment. 10/10, would recommend!
- I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking, which I love. I used to share my notes in a public [Today I Learned (TIL) repo](https://github.com/meganesu/TIL), but since switching to Obsidian I haven't been keeping that up to date. I'd like to get back to learning in public, but at the moment I'm still tinkering with my personal knowledge management setup.

## Things I Want to Learn

- SVGs and animations
- Blender
- Game design and development
- CSS
