title: "The 2010's: A Decade in Review"

It's hard to believe we're already in the second month of 2020. Since the New Year, I've been reflecting on the last ten years of my life - how I've changed, how I haven't. One surprising realization I had: everything I know about computers, I've learned in the past decade. It's been a bit of a roundabout path from writing my first lines of code to becoming a full-time software engineer. I know I'm a bit late to the game, but I wanted to take a moment to check in on my career and my growth as a developer so far. If nothing else, I hope it will be a useful data point when I look back again at the start of 2030.

The 2010's were a big decade for me. I became a full-fledged adult. I graduated from high school and from college. I lived in four different cities across three states, learned to program, and fell in love with teaching others how to use technology for good. The rest of this post will be my attempt to succinctly recap major life events and things I've learned.

The last decade almost completely encapsulates my entire career in tech, from my first steps writing C code in my first CS class in college through to my current job as a software developer at ThoughtWorks. It's been an interesting journey. One that I resisted, at first.

## 2010 - 2014: The College Years

When I graduated high school in 2010, I didn't really know anything about programming, even though I was about to head off to college as a declared computer engineering major. The program was a mix of computer science and electrical engineering, and I'd picked it because I liked programming the light board in my high school tech theater class. I thought that maybe lighting design and electrical engineering would somehow be connected (although really the only connection I could make at the time was that they both required electricity).

2010: 
* First programming class. Redekopp's 499. "what is going on?!"
* Sleeping through lectures, getting used to being a student without parents hanging over me.
* Made friends that I'd end up sticking with (CS Haus, David, Steven?), but most of them already seemed to know what was going on. They'd done programming in high school
* Mo had to help me step by step through homework projects.
* Showing mom my hangman game at parent weekend.
* Went to Redekopp's office hours a lot - me and Nayeon and Steven, all new to programming. Redekopp drawing out diagrams (this is what memory looks like, how the values change when you're manipulating pointers), which really helped make things click (felt concrete, like I could finally wrap my head around it). Learning to think like a computer.
* Final project: robotics obstacle course, only contributed flowchart diagrams (no code)

2011:
* Cried when Nazarian pulled me aside after class
* Sophomore year
* EE 201 (Ung)
    * started sitting in the front in my EE class (Ung's "marines")
    * Paired with Mo on Minesweeper solver
* Started 3D animation minor (wanted to work at Pixar)
* Sat in on Intro to Cinema. It made me feel things that none of my CS classes did. (Check my application essay for more details.) I decided I was going to apply to the film school. Worked on my application with Shawn Juju.
* CSCI 200
    * Factory project part 1. Opted to work on the art, so that I wouldn't have to do the programming.

2012:
* Found out I got waitlisted for the film school. Decided to keep taking classes anyway, what's one more minor?
* Officially enrolled in Intro to Cinema
* CSCI 201
    * Factory project part 2. Worked on the implementation of one class, and I'm pretty sure that's all the code I wrote. I'm not sure what else I contributed to that project.
* GEOL 125
    * Taught lessons through JEP. 6th grade classroom.
* EE 357
    * Redekopp round 2. Flipped classroom, really helped me spend more time at home processing the content at my own pace.
    * Paired with Mo, but it was still mostly me navigating.
* Fall
* CSCI 480
    * Technical elective. Took it because I was hoping it would help me work at Pixar. The professor was a good advocate for me. He wrote me a letter of rec I think?



// Notes

### 2010

- Graduated from high school, leaving the nest
- I'd gotten into USC as a computer engineering major. I had friends from high school that teased me about picking a major in a field that I knew next to nothing about. One of my close friends actually wrote in my yearbook that he'd help me figure out how to turn on my computer. But I knew I was good at learning things - I'd taught myself AP Chemistry and gotten a 5 on the AP test - how much harder could it be to learn computer science?
- Fall semester: Started at USC as a CS major. First CS class: Redekopp's 499. First time I was not good at something, struggling to learn. (Also struggled to stay awake during class - being an 18-year-old living without parent supervision for the first time meant many late nights staying up watching Chuck or A Very Potter Musical.) But also had people from high school who had teased me about not being able to do CS, and I felt like I needed to prove them wrong.
- It was also the class where I met people who would end up being some of my best friends from college. But a large number of them had all been programming since they were younger, and they weren't always empathetic when I struggled with what they deemed "easy" concepts. Monroe was a godsend, and spent hours helping me figure out the first few assignments.
- I had to learn how to go to office hours and ask for help. I was nervous about it because it meant admitting that I didn't understand what was going on, and I felt embarrassed about that. I'd always been able to figure things out on my own before.

Other notable things that happened:

- Saw Obama speak at USC for Jerry Brown's reelection.
- Became a football person (fight on!)

2011

- Moved into the CS Haus.
- Summer internship at NERSC. Did my own thing. Mostly taught another intern how to program.

2012

- Took an art class (FA 101)
- Started ballroom dancing club?
- Took a geology class as a GE, and taught weekly lessons to 6th-grade students at a school nearby.
- Wanted to switch out of CS. Applied to the film school, but got waitlisted.
- Summer internship at NERSC, this time with Josh and Monroe.
- Hairspray - last time I was in a show

2013

- Started finding a groove in CS classes. Started asking more questions (because I had a solid group of friends and I realized that none of them knew what was going on either).
- Senior year - started working as a course producer
- Played a lot of Just Dance at the CS Haus
- CS Haus Big Bear trip
- USC beat Stanford, and we all rushed the field
- Clark moved out
- Went to India - Alternative Winter Break

2014

- Winston my starfish student
- Interned at GameDesk, filmed and edited a customer success story
- WRIT 340 - Still Good in Me
- Went to Disneyland MANY times
- Graduated from USC, magna cum laude (0.01 GPA point away from summa cum laude, but whatever)

## 2014 - 2018: From Student to Teacher

2014

- Moved to New York
- Started City Year, worked with students, worked with an awesome team
- City Year was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it's also the most rewarding.
- Physically exhausting (Had to be at school by 7:30am and didn't leave until 5pm every day M-Th; F was for "professional development", aka training at the CY office downtown. Crashed pretty much every night as soon as I got home.)
- Felt pulled in a million different directions.
- I got to form a good rapport with pretty much every student in my class. It helped that I was the in-class support (as opposed to the full-time teacher), so I could pull out students on an individual basis without needing to worry about what to do with the rest of the class.
- Working for an organization whose values I believed in (even if the execution wasn't always up to par - young people leading young people doesn't always leave room for learning from great mentors)
- Ubuntu. I am a person through other people. My humanity is tied to yours.
- Learning patience! You have to be able to meet people where they're at. This might be the first time they've encountered something. The "problem" students are usually just missing some crucial skill that they haven't learned yet. (Lost at School)
- Learning to let go. Some things don't matter. Kids are kids - they need to play and be loud and run around. It's exhausting to try and focus for 8 hours straight.
- Talk to kids like they're people (because they are!). And it makes them more likely to actually listen to you.
- Teachers deserve to be paid way more than they are.
- If you're in charge, you're setting the bar for the enthusiasm of the group. (Caroline, Ms. Salguero.) No one is ever going to be more hyped about something than you are, so it's your job to set that bar high. You'll always be the upper bound for enthusiasm.
- I started teaching my students how to code, using the Code.org Hour of Code curriculum. Every day, I'd pull up a couple kids from lunch to hang out with me in the City Year office (an old classroom that used to be the AP's office), and they'd work in pairs to solve puzzles on my iPad. I'd help them when they got stuck, making sticky note "maps" on the ground so they could pretend to be the Angry Bird and play through the puzzle themselves. My favorite moment was one day when a student (a girl) exlaimed with surprise, "I never knew I was such a good programmer!"
- I learned about how important curriculum design is. Started learning Understanding By Design framework (VERY loosely applied to our after school clubs).
- I learned so many things that - while I didn't realize it at the time - have made me a better consultant and teammate. I could do a whole blog post about that (convert Pecha Kucha).


2015

- Went on a roadtrip across the US and back
- Struggled with being unemployed and directionless for the first time in my life
- Got an internship at Code.org, moved to Seattle
- Cosmo died

2016

- Left Code.org after internship, started at Girls Who Code (thanks to Sarah Filman for putting me in touch with Emily). My first big girl job!
- GWC was just building out their first education team. Went to first teacher training like a month after starting. We were a new team without a manager at that point, trying to figure out how to collaborate cross-coast.
- Erin got Harley
- Applied for ThoughtWorks, but they only had spots left in Dallas or Atlanta, and I wasn't ready to leave New York (Erin was moving into the building), so I resolved to wait to apply until the next year

2017

- Went to SIGCSE, got to see old Code.org friends again
- Presented at a bunch of conferences (that thing at Columbia, Jewish kids convention BBYOIC)
- Diana put me in charge of the SIP curriculum. I got to lead a team, got to think through an entire product from high level down to nitty gritty details. Worked with a truly amazing team to create a product that I was proud of.

## 2018 - 2019: Megan Who Codes

2018

- Left Girls Who Code, started at ThoughtWorks (also took a detour to Zapata Ranch, and fulfilled my lifetime dream of living on a ranch)
- ThoughtWorks University - a month in China, had just come from creating SIP, so I was using a really particular lens experiencing TWU as a student while also trying to understand the architecture of the program from an instructor's view. Met wonderful people from all over the world, climbed a mountain to the top of the world. Focused on bringing other people up and making them feel more confident (esp non-native English speakers).
- Test-driven development & focus on quality
- Worked on accessibility stories and started getting really interested in that, used a screen reader for the first time

2019

- First TW reflection: show the emotion map for my first six months.
- Made a thing! Game Boy opcode table. First time actually "finishing" something (in the way that any tech project is ever really "finished").
- Feedback: be more assertive, it sounds like you're not sure of yourself, which makes it hard to trust what I'm saying. Realized that I had gotten into the habit of undermining myself, saying things like, "I'm not really sure how this works but I think this is what's going on," even when I was pretty sure I was right, because I wanted to be able to back-pedal if I was wrong. And maybe also wanted to acknowledge that I'm not an expert? Because I hate people who fake like they know what they're talking about when they're really just spewing nonsense. But it was a helpful wake-up call to hear that that downplaying was really making things worse for my teammates (or at least one person)

Other things of note:

- Saw The Biggest Little Farm, started caring a lot about sustainability
- Started volunteering at OAS!
- The year of wanting to get a dog - tried and failed upwards of 7 times to get a dog. Sully, May, Eggo, Spruce, Sasha, Tugboat, Buckwheat

## Looking Forward: Goals for 2020

- Start working 100% remote! (Commuting is killing me, especially in the winter - it's dark when I wake up and dark when I get home from work. It's also expensive - $12 a day on bus fare, plus another $10+ for lunch.)
- GET A DOG. The precursor to this is getting a house. I've started seriously saving (and we moved in with my grandparents to cut rent costs), so hopefully that will come together sometime this year or the next.
- Make another tech project. Start this blog. Build more of an online presence.
- Build something with my hands. Maybe a computer? (Ben Eater 8-bit breadboard computer - https://eater.net/shop) Maybe woodworking? Build something that's not on a screen.
- Get promoted to senior developer. I've been trying to be more assertive and be confident when I know things.
- Learn data things. Data science, data engineering, data visualization. Use datacamp subscription from work!
