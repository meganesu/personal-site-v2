title: "The 2010's: A Decade in Review"
author: "Megan Sullivan"

It's hard to believe we're already in the second month of 2020. Since the New Year, I've been reflecting on the last ten years of my life - how I've changed, how I haven't. One surprising realization I had: everything I know about computers, I've learned in the past decade. It's been a bit of a roundabout path from writing my first lines of code to becoming a full-time software engineer. I know I'm a bit late to the game, but I wanted to take a moment to check in on my career and my growth as a developer so far. If nothing else, I hope it will be a useful data point when I look back again at the start of 2030.

---

The 2010's were a big decade for me. I became a full-fledged adult. I graduated from high school and from college. I lived in four different cities across three states, learned to program, and fell in love with teaching others how to use technology for good. The rest of this post will be my attempt to succinctly recap major life events and things I've learned.

The last decade almost completely encapsulates my entire career in tech, from my first steps writing C code in my first CS class in college through to my current job as a software developer at ThoughtWorks. It's been an interesting journey. One that I resisted, at first.

## 2010 - 2014: The College Years

When I graduated high school in 2010, I didn't really know anything about programming, even though I was about to head off to college as a declared computer engineering major. The program was a mix of computer science and electrical engineering, and I'd picked it because I liked programming the light board in my high school tech theater class. I thought that maybe lighting design and electrical engineering would somehow be connected (although really the only connection I could make at the time was that they both required electricity).

Big Ideas:
* I really struggled with my engineering classes at first
* I wanted to switch out of CS. Picked up two minors. Loved the work, but then was strapped for time, so I took the easy way of my engineering classes when I could.
    * Did art for mobile games, factory, artist management for Maestros
    * I was always focused on getting the grades, which I continued to do. But I wasn't focused on the learning. Thought I was working the system. If I could go back and do it again, I might do it differently. But I also loved those extra classes I got to take, so maybe I wouldn't.
* CS 402: Started taking ownership of my learning. Started participating.
    * Imposter syndrome aha moment - "Oh, NO ONE knows what's going on." Started being unashamed of asking questions.
* Didn't want a career in CS, because I didn't want to be a "code monkey" at a big tech company. I wanted to do work that mattered - that impacted others' lives for good. (In retrospect, I think this was because college didn't give me a good idea of what being a software developer is really like. I also had NO female role models - there was no one in the school that was doing what I wanted to be doing - except maybe Redekopp.)
    * TAing was a fulfilling job
    * City Year was at the job fair

2010: 
* Graduated from high school, leaving the nest
* I'd gotten into USC on scholarship as a computer engineering major. I had friends from high school that teased me about picking a major in a field that I knew next to nothing about. One of my close friends actually wrote in my yearbook that he'd help me figure out how to turn on my computer. But I knew I was good at learning things - I'd taught myself AP Chemistry and gotten a 5 on the AP test - how much harder could it be to learn computer science?
* Fall semester: Started at USC as a CS major. First CS class: Redekopp's 499. First time I was not good at something, struggling to learn. "What is going on?!" (Also struggled to stay awake during class - being an 18-year-old living without parent supervision for the first time meant many late nights staying up watching Chuck or A Very Potter Musical.) But also had people from high school who had teased me about not being able to do CS, and I felt like I needed to prove them wrong.
* It was also the class where I met people who would end up being some of my best friends from college. But a large number of them had all been programming since they were younger, and they already seemed to know what was going on. They weren't always empathetic when I struggled with what they deemed "easy" concepts.
* Monroe was a godsend, and spent hours helping me figure out the first few assignments. Had to help me step by step through homework projects, basically navigating me through the whole thing, teaching me about concepts that I'd missed in class.
* I had to learn how to go to office hours and ask for help. I was nervous about it because it meant admitting that I didn't understand what was going on, and I felt embarrassed about that. I'd always been able to figure things out on my own before. Went to Redekopp's office hours a lot - me and Nayeon and Steven, all new to programming. Redekopp drawing out diagrams (this is what memory looks like, how the values change when you're manipulating pointers), which really helped make things click (felt concrete, like I could finally wrap my head around it). Learning to think like a computer.
* Showing mom my hangman game at parent weekend.
* Final project: robotics obstacle course, only contributed flowchart diagrams (no code)
* Other notable things that happened:
    * Saw Obama speak at USC for Jerry Brown's reelection.
    * Became a football person (fight on!)

2011:
* Cried when Nazarian pulled me aside after class
* Summer internship at NERSC. (Shout out to Christine.) Did my own thing. Mostly taught another intern how to program.
* Sophomore year
* Moved into the CS Haus.
* EE 201 (Ung)
    * started sitting in the front in my EE class (Ung's "marines")
    * Paired with Mo on Minesweeper solver
* Started 3D animation minor (wanted to work at Pixar)
* Sat in on Intro to Cinema. It made me feel things that none of my CS classes did. (Check my application essay for more details.) I decided I was going to apply to the film school. Worked on my application with Shawn Juju.
* CSCI 200
    * Factory project part 1. Opted to work on the art, so that I wouldn't have to do the programming.

2012:
* Found out I got waitlisted for the film school. Decided to keep taking classes anyway, what's one more minor?
    * Doing CS AND cinema AND 3D animation (fell in love with drawing and editing). Suddenly I was strapped for time - trying to fit in a second minor - so I took the easy way out of my engineering classes when I could.
* Officially enrolled in Intro to Cinema
* CSCI 201
    * Factory project part 2. Worked on the implementation of one class, and I'm pretty sure that's all the code I wrote. I'm not sure what else I contributed to that project.
* GEOL 125
    * Took a geology class as a GE, and taught weekly lessons through JEP to 6th-grade students at a school nearby.
* EE 357
    * Redekopp round 2. Flipped classroom, really helped me spend more time at home processing the content at my own pace.
    * Paired with Mo, but it was still mostly me navigating.
* Started ballroom dancing club?
* Summer
    * Internship at NERSC, this time with Josh and Monroe.
    * Hairspray - last time I was in a show
* Fall
* CSCI 480
    * Technical elective. Took it because I was hoping it would help me work at Pixar. The professor was a good advocate for me. He wrote me a letter of rec I think?
* CTPR 335 - Editing
    * Fell in love with the nitty gritty detail. I loved zooming in to the frame-by-frame details and then zooming out to think about the big picture as a whole. It felt like a great mix of technical/analytical work and creative work. A mix of right brain and left brain. I still love editing, and I'd love to work on it more. I had a TA who told me I was good at it, and he offered to help me get an internship at the place where he worked.
* CSCI 271 - Discrete Methods in CS (Golubchik?)
    * Only female professor I ever had in the CS department - actually, the only female professor I had in the entire Viterbi school of engineering. Maybe that's part of the reason I never really saw myself being a professional developer.
* ITP 360 - 3D Compositing and Visual Effects
    * Redid the entire alien movie. Learned the bad lesson that sometimes other people are incompetent and you need to do it all yourself.

2013:
* Spring
* Started finding a groove in CS classes. Started asking more questions (because I had a solid group of friends and I realized that none of them knew what was going on either).
* CSCI 402 - Operating Systems (Faber)
    * Class before midterms and final, to prep for the exam. Went through the slides ahead of time, writing up huge lists of questions and things I didn't understand. I started out asking only one or two questions in the exam prep lecture. After a few questions, I looked around nervously to see if there were other people who had questions of their own to ask. But when no one else raised their hand, I figured, "Well, if no one else is going to ask questions, then I will." It's the first time I really started participating during lectures. I had these long bullet lists of questions and things I didn't understand from going through the slides on my own. At first, I was a little nervous to be hogging most of the professor's focus, and I remember looking around to see if there were other people who had questions and were trying to jump into the conversation. But when I saw that no one else was taking my silence as an opportunity to jump in, I figured I might as well just keep asking my own questions. It was the first time I had really participated vocally in a lecture. I thought that people might get annoyed with me for asking so many questions, but they didn't seem to mind. Or if they did, they kept quiet about it. And I think the professor appreciated that someone was actually trying to take advantage of the study session he had planned. I remember following him (with a few other students) to his office hours after those classes, still trying to clarify my understanding and scribbling notes in the margins of my sheet of questions. At some point later on (maybe during my senior year?), he sent out an email recommending a few students for an internship or a job at some university-affiliated organization, and I was surprised to be included on the list. I didn't end up pursuing it, but it felt nice to be picked out of the crowd.
    * "Oh, NO ONE knows what's going on."
* Fall
* EE 364 - Intro to Probability and Statistics for Electrical Engineers (Chugg?)
    * Took what I'd learned from the test prep lectures in CS 402 and kicked it up a notch. I sat in the front row of every class, with Monroe and Clark and David and others. I started asking questions during all lectures - not just when a test was coming up. If I got lost during a lecture, I'd turn around to Mo or Clark and ask them, "Do you know what's going on right now?" And if I saw that they were also confused, I'd raise my hand to interrupt the professor, asking him to back up and reexplain whatever we were stuck on. And he didn't seem to mind either. And wouldn't you know it, asking questions helped me actually understand what was going on, and I outperformed most of my group of friends in that class (except Monroe, probably). That's when I really started to feel like I was hitting my stride in the CS program. Clark pointed out to me that I was one of the top students in our classes, and I got better grades than most of the CS Haus boys.
* CSCI 491A - Final Game Project
    * But even with all that, I was still opting for the "easy" route. Toward the end of junior year, Sean had asked if I wanted to join the Maestros team, a final games project that another housemate, Dru, was building. At that point, it sounded more interesting than what I'd heard about the standard CS final capstone class (which was about building something for an industry company or something like that), so I agreed. I can't remember how the conversations went, but I think they specifically wanted me on the team because of my 3D animation experience. I ended up being a manager for all the other animators on the team - remote folks who I'm not even sure were students? And so once again I was doing art instead of programming. At the time, I think I was relieved to not have another thing pulling my attention. This was an easy way to finish my final project requirement, and it allowed me to focus on other things.
* Applied for City Year. There was a job fair on campus, and they were one of the only organizations that was focused on doing good - not just making money. My sister was in New York, and I thought it would be great to be closer to her. I knew I didn't want to work as a full-time software developer - I didn't want to be a "code monkey" at a big tech company. I wanted to do work that mattered - that impacted others' lives for good. So I applied and got accepted!
* TA for CS 103, for Crowley
- Played a lot of Just Dance at the CS Haus
- CS Haus Big Bear trip
- USC beat Stanford, and we all rushed the field
- Clark moved out
- Went to India - Alternative Winter Break

2014:
* Spring.
* ITP 382 - Mobile Game Programming
    * Assigned to art, might have done a single thing in the codebase
* WRIT 340 - Advanced Writing
    * Still Good In Me. Francisco Homes, for ex-lifers.
    * Did the first edit alone, and was a little frustrated when teammates had suggestions. But after sucking it up and working together, I learned that not all group projects are bogus - sometimes having a group can help you make something better than you could have made alone.
* CSCI 491B - Final Game Project
    * Still managing the artists
* Interned at GameDesk, filmed and edited a customer success story
* TA for CS 103 again. Winston my starfish student. Working so closely with him made me really excited to be going to City Year. I liked helping people learn things.
* Went to Disneyland MANY times
* Shoutout to Steve Schrader, for being the best advisor. He helped me fit a major and two minors into four years. He let me tailor my college experience so that I could learn everything I wanted to learn. Without him, I wouldn't have had such a good mixture of technical classes and creative classes.
* Graduated from college! Magna cum laude (0.01 GPA point away from summa cum laude, but whatever), renaissance scholar. Spent a summer bouncing back between LA and the Bay, slowly moving out.

## 2014 - 2018: From Student to Teacher

2014

- Moved to New York
- Started City Year, worked with students, worked with an awesome team
- City Year was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it's also the most rewarding.
- Physically exhausting (Had to be at school by 7:30am and didn't leave until 5pm every day M-Th; F was for "professional development", aka training at the CY office downtown. Crashed pretty much every night as soon as I got home.)
- Felt pulled in a million different directions.
- I got to form a good rapport with pretty much every student in my class. It helped that I was the in-class support (as opposed to the full-time teacher), so I could pull out students on an individual basis without needing to worry about what to do with the rest of the class.
- Working for an organization whose values I believed in (even if the execution wasn't always up to par - young people leading young people doesn't always leave room for learning from great mentors)
- Ubuntu. I am a person through other people. My humanity is tied to yours.
- Learning patience! You have to be able to meet people where they're at. This might be the first time they've encountered something. The "problem" students are usually just missing some crucial skill that they haven't learned yet. (Lost at School)
- Learning to let go. Some things don't matter. Kids are kids - they need to play and be loud and run around. It's exhausting to try and focus for 8 hours straight.
- Talk to kids like they're people (because they are!). And it makes them more likely to actually listen to you.
- Teachers deserve to be paid way more than they are.
- If you're in charge, you're setting the bar for the enthusiasm of the group. (Caroline, Ms. Salguero.) No one is ever going to be more hyped about something than you are, so it's your job to set that bar high. You'll always be the upper bound for enthusiasm.
- I started teaching my students how to code, using the Code.org Hour of Code curriculum. Every day, I'd pull up a couple kids from lunch to hang out with me in the City Year office (an old classroom that used to be the AP's office), and they'd work in pairs to solve puzzles on my iPad. I'd help them when they got stuck, making sticky note "maps" on the ground so they could pretend to be the Angry Bird and play through the puzzle themselves. My favorite moment was one day when a student (a girl) exlaimed with surprise, "I never knew I was such a good programmer!"
- I learned about how important curriculum design is. Started learning Understanding By Design framework (VERY loosely applied to our after school clubs).
- I learned so many things that - while I didn't realize it at the time - have made me a better consultant and teammate. I could do a whole blog post about that (convert Pecha Kucha).

2015

- Went on a roadtrip across the US and back
- Struggled with being unemployed and directionless for the first time in my life
- Got an internship at Code.org, moved to Seattle
- Cosmo died

2016

- Left Code.org after internship, started at Girls Who Code (thanks to Sarah Filman for putting me in touch with Emily). My first big girl job!
- GWC was just building out their first education team. Went to first teacher training like a month after starting. We were a new team without a manager at that point, trying to figure out how to collaborate cross-coast.
- Erin got Harley
- Applied for ThoughtWorks, but they only had spots left in Dallas or Atlanta, and I wasn't ready to leave New York (Erin was moving into the building), so I resolved to wait to apply until the next year

2017

- Went to SIGCSE, got to see old Code.org friends again
- Presented at a bunch of conferences (that thing at Columbia, Jewish kids convention BBYOIC)
- Diana put me in charge of the SIP curriculum. I got to lead a team, got to think through an entire product from high level down to nitty gritty details. Worked with a truly amazing team to create a product that I was proud of.

## 2018 - 2019: Megan Who Codes

2018

- Left Girls Who Code, started at ThoughtWorks (also took a detour to Zapata Ranch, and fulfilled my lifetime dream of living on a ranch)
- ThoughtWorks University - a month in China, had just come from creating SIP, so I was using a really particular lens experiencing TWU as a student while also trying to understand the architecture of the program from an instructor's view. Met wonderful people from all over the globe, climbed a mountain to the top of the world. Focused on bringing other people up and making them feel more confident (esp non-native English speakers).
- Test-driven development & focus on quality
- Worked on accessibility stories and started getting really interested in that, used a screen reader for the first time

2019

- First TW reflection: show the emotion map for my first six months.
- Made a thing! Game Boy opcode table. First time actually "finishing" something (in the way that any tech project is ever really "finished").
- Feedback: be more assertive, it sounds like you're not sure of yourself, which makes it hard to trust what I'm saying. Realized that I had gotten into the habit of undermining myself, saying things like, "I'm not really sure how this works but I think this is what's going on," even when I was pretty sure I was right, because I wanted to be able to back-pedal if I was wrong. And maybe also wanted to acknowledge that I'm not an expert? Because I hate people who fake like they know what they're talking about when they're really just spewing nonsense. But it was a helpful wake-up call to hear that that downplaying was really making things worse for my teammates (or at least one person)

Other things of note:

- Saw The Biggest Little Farm, started caring a lot about sustainability
- Started volunteering at OAS!
- The year of wanting to get a dog - tried and failed upwards of 7 times to get a dog. Sully, May, Eggo, Spruce, Sasha, Tugboat, Buckwheat

## Looking Forward: Goals for 2020

- Start working 100% remote! (Commuting is killing me, especially in the winter - it's dark when I wake up and dark when I get home from work. It's also expensive - $12 a day on bus fare, plus another $10+ for lunch.)
- GET A DOG. The precursor to this is getting a house. I've started seriously saving (and we moved in with my grandparents to cut rent costs), so hopefully that will come together sometime this year or the next.
- Make another tech project. Start this blog. Build more of an online presence.
- Build something with my hands. Maybe a computer? (Ben Eater 8-bit breadboard computer - https://eater.net/shop) Maybe woodworking? Build something that's not on a screen.
- Get promoted to senior developer. I've been trying to be more assertive and be confident when I know things.
- Learn data things. Data science, data engineering, data visualization. Use datacamp subscription from work!
