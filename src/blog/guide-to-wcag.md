# A Quick Guide to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Documents

Target Audience: People who already know what accessibility is and who want to know how to do it "right". These people might be wanting to learn the fundamentals and form a big picture understanding, or they might be working on a project (new or existing) and want to learn how to make it accessible.
* For readers completely new to accessibility, refer them to a different resource. W3C has put together a great series of documents in their [Accessibility Fundamentals Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/).

As more and more things move online because of COVID Times, it's now even more important for creators to make sure their tools and technologies have accessibility baked into their functionality. There are lots of great resources online when it comes to web accessibility. I've been learning a lot more about accessibiilty over the last few months, and one resource that I keep getting coming back to is the WCAG. This document, created by W3C, is like the North Star for web accessibility. It's also a bit overwhelming when you first get into it.

## What is WCAG?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a set of standards for how developers and online creators can make their content more accessible for people with disabilities.

There are a ton of different documents with similar names (Techniques for WCAG, Understanding WCAG, How to Meet WCAG), which makes it hard to know what exactly you should be looking at. In this post, I'm going to do my best to demystify the WCAG documents and explain the architecture for how all the different pieces fit together.

## The WCAG Documents

As of WCAG version 2.1, there are four main documents in this suite:

* [WCAG 2.1]: The rubric
* [Techniques for WCAG 2.1]: The cheat sheet for developers
* [Understanding WCAG 2.1]: The extended commentary
* [How to Meet WCAG 2.1]: The interactive reference tool
    
### WCAG 2.1 (The Rubric)

* The actual guidelines, organized into four main principles (POUR)
* Each guideline is broken down further into success criteria, for specific things you can test
* Success criteria for each guideline
* Include A/AA/AAA breakdown
    * To conform to A, have to meet all A success criteria. To conform to AA, have to meet all A *and* AA success criteria. To conform to AAA, have to meet all success criteria (A, AA, and AAA).

### Techniques for WCAG 2.1 (The Cheat Sheet)

* Implementation strategies, organized by technology
* Also includes section for Common Failures

### Understanding WCAG 2.1 (The Extended Commentary)

* For people who want more thorough understanding of the guidelines
* Includes intent of guideline, additional resources
* Links techniques/failures to WCAG criteria

### How to Meet WCAG 2.1 (The Interactive Reference Tool)

* Summary of all the other docs' content
* Filterable by A/AA/AAA, success/failure

## How to Use The WCAG Documents

* Building a site from scratch
* Improving accessibility of an existing site
