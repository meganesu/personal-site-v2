# A Quick Guide to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Documents

As more and more things move online because of COVID Times, it's now even more important for creators to make sure their tools and technologies have accessibility baked into their functionality. There are lots of great resources online when it comes to web accessibility. I've been learning a lot more about accessibiilty over the last few months, and one resource that I keep getting coming back to is the WCAG. This document, created by W3C, is like the North Star for web accessibility. It's also a bit overwhelming when you first get into it.

There are a ton of different documents with similar names (Techniques for WCAG, Understanding WCAG, How to Meet WCAG), which makes it hard to know what exactly you should be looking at. In this post, I'm going to do my best to demystify the WCAG documents and explain the architecture for how all the different pieces fit together.

## The WCAG Documents

* [WCAG 2.1]: The rubric
    * The actual guidelines, organized into four main principles (POUR)
    * Success criteria for each guideline
    * Include A/AA/AAA breakdown
* [How to Meet WCAG 2.1]: The interactive reference tool
    * Summary of all the other docs' content
    * Filterable by A/AA/AAA, success/failure

    * Implementation strategies, organized by technology
    * Also includes section for Common Failures
* [Understanding WCAG 2.1]: The extended commentary
