# Navigating the W3C Web Accessibility Documents

Readers will be able to:
* Name the docs that make up the WAI suite
* Understand how the docs work together to create standards for the full web experience
* Identify which docs are relevant to their particular project

Intro: I've wanted to learn more about accessibility. I'd worked on a few accessibility stories here and there, making specific improvements to the client website I was staffed on. I wanted to try and go to the official documents, to get a better big picture of how everything was supposed to fit together.

How I started learning about a11y:
* Started doing one-off stories to make incremental improvements to our site at work.
* Wanted to get a better sense of the big picture - a11y as a whole.
* Wanted to look at the official docs. But there's so much there!

Goal of this series is to help newcomers to a11y feel more comfortable navigating the resources created by W3C WAI. Know what tools are available to you, and how to use them.

Questions as a user interested in accessibility:
* How do I get started with accessibility?
* How do I know what my site needs to be able to do?
* How do I make my site do those things? (Meet the standards)


## What are the standards for good web accessibility?

* Goal of standards: To make user experience consistent across the web.
    * Why is a single set of standards important? For consistency. So that a person can go anywhere and know what to expect and have a good experience. (Like Common Core standards. The goal is to make sure everyone is working toward the same goal.)
        * https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/harmonization/
* Created by W3C (organization that makes web standards for other technologies as well). They have a project called the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), geared specifically at making websites more accessible.
* They do that by tackling the whole web development and consumption process. (Talk about the diagram of developers using authoring tools to create content, and users using user agents (browsers) to consume that content.)

* W3C: An organization that makes standards for the Web
* WAI: A subset of W3C that focuses specifically on developing standards and resources to help developers create accessible websites
* Three main docs: WCAG, ATAG, UAAG
    * Each doc focuses on a different part of the web experience, but they all work together to reinforce a consistent set of accessibility standards to make websites usable for everyone.
    * Goal of these docs is to provide a comprehensive set of standards for the entire web process, from creation and consumption. The tools people use to create content, the content itself, and the tools people use to consume that content.


## How do the W3C WAI docs fit together?

* The WAI is made up of a suite of documents, each of which is aimed at a different point in that process.
    * The WCAG is a set of standards for the content that developers create
    * The ATAG is a set of standards for the authoring tools that developers use to create content
    * The UAAG is a set of standards for the user agents (like browsers and media players) that let users consume content

## How do I know which standards I should look at for my project?

* It depends on what kind of project you're building
