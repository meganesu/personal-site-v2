## Introduction

Earlier this month, I co-facilitated a 4-hour workshop at GatsbyConf. I'm used to leading workshops in person, but this was my first time teaching remotely.

In this post, I'll summarize the strategies we used to boost student engagement and highlight some of the lessons I learned along the way.

## Preparation (before the workshop)

* Curriculum site.
    * Purpose: Like the virtual replacement for a worksheet or textbook.
        * Reference (like a textbook): Something students can reference to learn the material
        * Exercise prompts (like a worksheet): Keep students on task if they missed the instructions. Frees you up from answering questions like "what are we supposed to be doing right now?"
            * Clear goal: What are they trying to accomplish in this exercise? How will they know when they're done?
            * Scaffolding: Hints and solution.
    * This also ties into differentiation - giving students multiple ways to engage with the material. (Slides, written curriculum site. In a perfect world, I would have loved to have produced edited videos walking students through the solutions or explaining the content.)
    * Repeat the important bits. Just because you said/wrote it once, doesn't mean that students will retain it. Help them see what are the important concepts by calling back to them throughout the workshop. (This applies to in-person workshops too.)
* Build in checks for understanding throughout each section. Use polls to gauge where students are at. Student engagement. (In an in-person workshop, you'd be able to look around at people's expressions and get a sense for whether they understand you or not. But when you're talking to your computer screen, you need another way to get that input from students.)
    * Fist to five - judge their understanding / level of comfort with the material.
    * Pulse checks - check how far they got on an exercise.
* Technical difficulties.
    * Make sure you have live captions set up ahead of time.
    * Test your EXACT setup before the day of. I set up a second monitor the night before the workshop, thinking it would be nice to be able to see my notes alongside the screen I'm sharing. But that caused some resolution problems, which meant that my screen sharing was messed up and had weird artifacts whenever I tried to change slides. Not great. That could have been avoided if I'd tested my exact laptop setup ahead of time.

## Instruction (on the day)

You'll need to prepare all of these ahead of time as well, but th

* If possible, have a few extra teammates help out as TAs in the chat. That way, you can focus on presenting the material, and then TAs can help one-off students with their specific bugs.
    * When specific issues come up in chat, you can ask the TAs to help out, so that you don't have to derail the entire lesson.
* Use timers. It helps students know how long they have to work on an exercise. It also helps you with time management. (This is a good technique for in-person teaching too.)
* But also, be flexible. If you see that students are confused, it's okay to fall behind schedule and take the extra time needed to help them understand the material. Better to not get through all the content you planned and have students following you than to rush to get through everything and leave students behind.
* As the instructor, you are the upper threshold for enthusiasm. That doesn't mean you have to be super peppy (although in my experience as a student I find that easier to pay attention to), but you should be excited about what you're teaching. If you sound bored by what you're talking about, it's going to be significantly harder for your students to be excited about it.
    * Try to avoid couching your expectations, "okay I know this is boring, but..." Find what's exciting or interesting about what you're doing. If it's not exciting, why is it important? Why does what you're teaching them matter? Why should they care?
    * As the teacher, you are modeling how students should behave, even if they don't consciously realize it. So the way you react when you run into problems will set the tone for how they should behave. Remember to model a growth mindset. There's nothing wrong with making mistakes - it's natural! Mistakes are opportunities to learn something new. Normalize a culture of error. And be kind to students and yourself when things don't go as planned.

## Wrap It Up

Teaching a workshop remotely introduces some new challenges. But it also provides the opportunity to increase the number of people who see your work.
