## Introduction

One of the best ways to deeply learn a subject is by teaching it to others. But being a good teacher isn't as easy as just sharing everything you know about a topic. How can you make sure you're teaching in a way that's actually helping people learn?

I've been teaching since 2014, and over the years I've read a lot about learning and education. Here's a list of my favorite resources on how to become a better educator.

## My #1 recommentation

### [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/), by Greg Wilson

If you only read one book from this list, let it be this one.

Extremely well researched. The whole time I was reading I was nodding my head emphatically at each new point.

Quote from publisher's website:

> Hundreds of grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills outside traditional classrooms. These groups exist so that people don't have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and instructors are often teaching themselves how to teach.
>
> There's a better way. This book presents evidence-based practices that will help you create and deliver lessons that work and build a teaching community around them. Topics include the differences between different kinds of learners, diagnosing and correcting misunderstandings, teaching as a performance art, what motivates and demotivates adult learners, how to be a good ally, fostering a healthy community, getting the word out, and building alliances with like-minded groups. The book includes over a hundred exercises that can be done individually or in groups, over 350 references, and a glossary to help you navigate educational jargon.

## Resources on how people learn

### [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), by Barbara Oakley

Cognitive science research about how to optimize your learning strategies so that they fit how your brain already works.

Quote from Coursera course page:

> This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We'll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We'll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.  
>
> Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.

### [Make It Stick](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674729018), by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel

Quote from the publisher's website:

> Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, _Make It Stick_ will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.

### [Practice Perfect](https://teachlikeachampion.com/books/practice-perfect/), by Doug Lemov, Erica Woolway, and Katie Yezzi

Quote from the publisher's website:

> By researching the latest in brain and behavioral science and in their work training teachers with Uncommon Schools, the authors found that what you do in practice matters as much if not more than how much you practice. There is a right way and a wrong way to practice. The right way involves breaking through assumptions, modeling excellent practice, using feedback, creating a culture of practice, making new skills stick, and hiring for practice.

## Resources on designing educational content

### [Understanding by Design](https://www.ascd.org/books/understanding-by-design-expanded-2nd-edition?variant=103055), by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe

About backward design, a framework for curriculum design. Starting planning from learning objectives. 

Quote from the introduction:

> As the title suggests, this book is about good design—of curriculum, assessment, and instruction—focused on developing and deepening understanding of important ideas. Posed as a question, considered throughout the book and from many perspectives, the essence of this book is this: How do we make it more likely—by our design—that more students really understand what they are asked to learn? So often, by contrast, those who "get it" are learners who come to us already able and articulate—understanding by good fortune. What must our planning entail to have an intellectual impact on everyone: the less experienced; the highly able, but unmotivated; the less able; those with varied interests and styles?

### [Head First series](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?query=head%20first)

A masterclass on how to make technical content engaging and "sticky" so that it's easier for learners to digest and retain.

Quote from the introduction of the 2nd edition of [Head First Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/9781492091646/):

> We've all had the "I really want to learn this but I can't stay awake past page one" experience. Your brain pays attenetion to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn't have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it's not.

### [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing](https://docsfordevelopers.com/), by Jared Bhatti, Zachary Sarah Corleissen, Jen Lambourne, David Nunez, and Heidi Waterhouse

Also helpful for technical writers.

> We created this field guide to technical documentation by building on our own expertise and feedback from a multitude of developers. It's designed as a resource to keep at hand, so you can write documentation as part of your software development process.
>
> This book walks you through creating documentation from scratch. It begins with identifying the needs of your users and creating a plan with common patterns of documentation, then moves through the process of drafting, editing, and publishing your content. The book concludes with practical advice about integrating feedback, measuring effectiveness, and maintaining your documentation as it grows.

## Resources on classroom management

### [Lost at School](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Lost-at-School/Ross-W-Greene/9781501101496), by Ross W. Greene.

From "Kids do well if they want to" to "Kids do well if they can." Behavior management strategy that stems from meeting students where they are, and working together to find solutions to problem behaviors. (Also a good read for anyone in management or for parents.)

Quote from the introduction:

> Helping kids with social, emotional, and behavioral challenges is not a mechanical exercise. Kids aren't robots, adults aren't robots, and helping them work together isn't robotic. The work is hard, messy, uncomfortable, and requires teamwork, patience, and tenacity, especially as the work also involves questioning conventional wisdom and practice. This book contains lots of material and examples to help you better understand challenging kids, how to implement the [Collaborative Problem Solving] model, and how to work collaboratively toward the common goal of helping these kids more effectively.

### [Teach Like a Champion](https://teachlikeachampion.com/?books=teach-like-a-champion-3-0), by Doug Lemov.

Practical tips for everything from facilitating discussions to building a culture of error.

Quote from the book's website:

> Upon studying videos of high-performing teachers, Lemov distills their methods into concrete tangible actions for others to use and adapt...
>
> Through the techniques, Lemov explains how to Check for Understanding, raise academic expectations, increase the ratio of the cognitive work students do, motivate and engage students, make classrooms more writing-intensive, improve discussions, and anticipate when it is necessary to redirect student behavior so it is positive and productive.
