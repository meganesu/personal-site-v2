## Introduction

We all need feedback to become our best selves. As Sarah Drasner says in her book, [*Engineering Management for the Rest of Us*](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/engineering-management-for-the-rest-of-us-sarah-drasner/1142398485), "We can steer our own ship to some extent, but at some point we can't always see our own work clearly, and we need input from others to improve."

A **360˚ speedback** is a type of meeting used for quickly sharing 1:1 feedback with teammates. (It's kind of like speed dating, but for exchanging feedback!) By the end of the meeting, everyone on the team will have shared feedback with everyone else.

In this post, you'll learn how to prepare for and facilitate your first speedback.


## How it works

### Before the meeting:

1. Teammates share their individual **goals** for what they're looking for feedback on.

	- This can be anything that the individual finds helpful: a behavior they're trying to improve, leadership skills they're developing, content areas they're trying to build expertise in, etc.
  
	- Store these goals in a shared document or spreadsheet. Using a spreadsheet is a handy way to track how goals change over time. Label each row with a teammate's name, and label each column with the date of the speedback session. In each cell, teammates can put the goals they're looking for feedback on for that speedback session. (Check out the example below.)

| Teammate | November 17, 2022 | October 6, 2022 |
| :---: | --- | :---: |
| Megan | **Meeting facilitation.** Do our meetings feel efficient? What could I improve about the way I facilitate? | ... |
| Tahia | **Code reviews.** Am I leaving a good balance of positive and constructive comments? | ... |
| Angelo | **Communication.** Are my standup updates clear and easy to understand? What kind of information is most helpful in these updates? | ... |

<CalloutBox>

**Tip:** Prepare this list of goals as far in advance as possible, so teammates have time to keep an eye out for specific behaviors and give more meaningful feedback. (Concrete examples of times they saw the behavior.)

2. The speedback facilitator creates the list of **pair rotations** for each round. (See the section below on [creating pair rotations](#creating-pair-rotations).)

3. The speedback facilitator creates the **meeting invite**.
    - The total meeting duration should be 7 minutes times the number of pair rotations. (So if your team has 5 rounds of pair rotations, the meeting should be roughly 35 minutes long.)

### During the meeting:

Complete as many rounds as it takes to get through all the pair rotations.

**Note:** Speedbacks can be run remotely or in person! This post assumes you're running a remote speedback.

If you're facilitating an in-person speedback, the process looks mostly the same. But instead of using Zoom breakout rooms, you'll need to designate separate quiet areas where each pair can speak in private.

</CalloutBox>

For each round:

1. **(1 minute)** The facilitator sets up separate Zoom breakout rooms for each pair, and everyone joins their assigned breakout room. (If in person, this time can be used for physically moving to the location for your next pairing.)

	- Each breakout room contains a single pair, Person A and Person B.

	- Have an odd number of participants? One person will be alone each round. I like to have this person look up a joke or fun fact to share with the group at the end of the round, when we come back together and the facilitator assigns the next set of breakout rooms.

2. **(3 minutes)** In each breakout room, one person sets a timer for 3 minutes. Then Person A gives Person B feedback. Person B listens and takes notes. Person B can ask follow-up questions if needed, but Person A should be doing most of the talking.

	- This feedback can be related to what Person B put in their goals, or it can be something else Person A thinks would be helpful to hear. (Praise, areas for growth, progress on the things they got feedback on in the last speedback, etc.)

3. **(3 minutes)** When the first timer goes off, switch roles, and set another timer for 3 minutes. Now Person B gives Person A feedback. Similarly, Person B should be doing most of the talking, while Person A listens.

4. When the second timer goes off, the pair rejoins the main Zoom and waits for the next round.

### After the meeting:

1. The facilitator schedules the next speedback! (I've found that having one speedback every 4-6 weeks is a good cadence. It's frequent enough to check in regularly, and spaced out enough to leave time to make meaningful progress.)

2. Teammates update their individual goals in the shared doc.

## Wrap it up

Speedbacks are a great time to celebrate your teammates and the hard work you all do. They also help us recognize where we still have room to grow and improve.

Giving and receiving feedback might seem scary at first. But the more you practice having these conversations, the easier they'll get. Hang in there!

**A closing caveat**

This one goes out to all you people-pleasers out there.

It's important to remember that feedback is a gift. But ultimately, you get to decide whether or not to act on a specific piece of feedback.

If something feels off about a suggestion, you don't *have* to address it. It's okay to note it as a single data point, and move on. That said, if you hear the same suggestion from multiple teammates, it may be a sign that you need to reevaluate something.

## Appendix: Creating pair rotations

These instructions will help the facilitator create the list of pair rotations for the speedback.

### If you have an **odd** number of participants:

1. For the first round, write everyone's names in two rows. Each column represents a pair who will be matched up for that round. There should be one empty space left.   

2. For the next round, rotate each person's name one position clockwise around the circle. Make sure to skip over the empty space, so that the empty space stays in the same position from the first round.

3. Continue rotating everyone around the circle for each round, until everyone makes it back to the position where they started.

Here's an example for a group of 5 participants (named A, B, C, D, and E):

### If you have an **even** number of participants:

The process for assigning pairs is similar, with one difference: After step 1, choose one person to stay in the same position for every round. Then rotate everyone else using the same process as before.

Here's an example with 4 participants (named A, B, C, and D):
