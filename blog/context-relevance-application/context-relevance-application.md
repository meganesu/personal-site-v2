When I was a curriculum developer, an advisor told me that there are three things that every piece of educational content needs:

• Context
• Relevance
• Application

Here's a short thread on what they are and how I use them to improve my teaching and technical writing.

1) Context: "What are you talking about?" Woman shrugging

People who end up on your doc/tutorial/blog post are all coming in with different backgrounds and experience levels.

You have to set the stage for them, to build a shared understanding before you dive into the details of your post.

How to provide context?

• Give a big picture view of what you're going to be talking about.
• Define any key terms or concepts that readers will need to understand. Be conversational, and avoid jargon as much as possible.

2) Relevance: "Why should I care about that?" Thinking face

This is where you motivate your readers to keep reading. Convince them that what you're talking about will help them.

What's the value add? How will it make their lives easier?

3) Application: "You've convinced me. Now how do I do it?"

Once you've convinced readers that your topic is worth talking about, show them the real-world application. Use code examples and self-contained demos.

(This is the piece that most technical writing already does well!)

Putting it to use:

When I'm outlining a new post, I'll start by writing down the context, relevance, and application for the content.

I like to keep these three pieces in mind from the start of the writing process, because it helps me stay in a reader-centered frame of mind.

When it comes to actually writing the content, I tend to put my context and relevance in the introduction, to help the reader get situated.

Then the main body of my post focuses more on application. (But you can also sprinkle in more context and relevance as needed!)

Here's an example, based on Part 3 of the new #GatsbyTutorial, which is about adding plugins to your Gatsby site.

(Here's the link, if you want to see it in context:
https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-3/
)

Context: "A plugin is an npm package that you install to add extra features to your site. Some plugins provide pre-built components, others add analytics, others let you pull data into your site. You can think of a plugin as an accessory for your site."

Relevance (1/2): "You don’t *need* to use plugins - you could build out the same functionality from scratch yourself - but they save you time."

Relevance (2/2): "They’re like those fancy single-purpose cooking gadgets that peel apples or crush garlic. You could accomplish the same task using a regular knife, but it’s often faster to use a tool that’s built to do that one specific job really well."

Application: This is the longer part, where I explain how to install and configure a plugin. I use code blocks with line highlighting, as well as text explaining what the code is doing and what readers should pay attention to.

"Context, Relevance, Application" has become a mantra for me while I'm writing educational content.

It's just one way to think about writing, but it's been helpful for me when creating and reviewing docs.

Hopefully it helps you too!
