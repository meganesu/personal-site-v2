## Introduction

It's almost the end of 2020 (yay!), which means it's time to make sure you've used up all of your professional development (PD) budget for the year!

**Out of ideas?** Here's a list of some resources I've either used or added to my own wishlist. It's mostly geared toward my own interests: web development, accessibility, and education.

> Full disclosure: I don't have partnerships with any of these products, I just genuinely think they're neat!
