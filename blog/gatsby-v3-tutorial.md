## Introduction

Gatsby recently published the first three parts of the new [official Gatsby Tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial)! Like the previous version, this Tutorial guides newcomers through the process of creating and deploying their first Gatsby site, teaching core Gatsby and React concepts along the way. But now the content has been updated to reflect the new best practices, following the [release of Gatsby v3.0 and other core features](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsbyconf-product-announcements) (a new image plugin, file system routes, and Gatsby Hosting, to name a few).

The rest of this post outlines some of the changes we made to the Tutorial, to improve the learning experience and help newcomers build their mental models for how all the pieces of a Gatsby site fit together.

## Keeping what worked well

The v2 version of the Tutorial did many things well. We wanted to make sure that our changes didn't impact what was already working.

The key features we wanted to hang onto were:

* **Approachable to folks without previous React or GraphQL experience.** Adjustment: assume some basic web development knowledge. While folks without previous HTML, CSS, or JS knowledge could conceivably still follow the Tutorial, realistically it will help them to have some basic understanding of those core technologies beforehand. We do still have callout boxes to explain some JS syntax things, but we don't explain every line.

* Code snippets. Easy to copy-paste. Use line highlighting to direct learner's attention to the important bits. 

Things that the old Tutorial did well:

* Assuming zero previous experience with web development.
* Use of emojis to indicate type of content.
* Copy-pasteable code snippets.
* Using code line highlighting to direct learner’s attention.

Things that we wanted to improve:
* Only provide as much explanation as is necessary.
* Remove everything that isn’t directly getting learners closer to achieving the objective for that section.
* Highlight processes to help learners build mental models. Highlight common processes that they'll need to transfer to their own projects (define a component, install a plugin, write a GraphQL query)
* Split parts into more manageable chunks.
* Highlight the learning goals at the top of each part.


## Build on the same project in each part

## Expose the architecture of the Tutorial

## Clarify learning goals

Each part has a clear set of objectives. Let learners know what they’ll be able to do by the end of the section. Focus on transferable skills.

Highlight the learning goals at the top of each part.

Remove everything that isn’t directly getting learners closer to achieving the objective for that section.

## Consistent structure across sections

## Highlight Key Gatsby Concepts

Help readers build their mental model of the pieces of a Gatsby site and how they fit together.

* Labeled subgoals: Breaking down a process into smaller steps, to help readers see patterns in processes they'll need to repeat when building their own sites. How to write a React component, how to add a plugin, how to create a GraphQL query.
    * "Labeling subgoals works because grouping related steps into named chunks helps learners distinguish what's generic from what is specific to the problem at hand. It also helps them build a mental model of that kind of problem so that they can solve other problems of that kind, and gives them a natural opportunity for self-explanation." pg 32-33, Teaching Tech Together, Greg Wilson.

## Use visual diagrams to explain concepts

## Add checks for understanding

## What's Next?

So far, we've released the first three parts of the new Gatsby Tutorial:

* Part 0: Set Up Your Development Environment
* Part 1: ?
* Part 2:

But there's still more to come! Future parts will be published as I finish writing them. Here's an outline of what's planned so far:

* Part 3:
* Part 4:
* Part 5:
* Part 6:
* Part 7:
